# GetCleanData_Coursera
Repo in support of the Coursera 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course assignment, https://class.coursera.org/getdata-031/forum/thread?thread_id=28 .  Please be advised that this code may be non/mal-functional at this time.

The original data is of motion tracking devices, see: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Input Data
-----

The input data is from: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
This will need to be downloaded and decompressed into a local directory prior to use / demonstration of the code.

Output Data
-----

It is asserted - there is some debate as to the precisely how the data should be filtered - that the dataset is 'tidy' following the guidlines of Wickman (specifically: http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10) and the discussion on the Coursera forum, specifically the post of Hood (https://class.coursera.org/getdata-031/forum/thread?thread_id=113).  Due to the somewhat cryptic data naming conventions of the original data and the assessment requirements.



Repo Contents
-----

This repos contains:
*) the script to do the analyis downloaded (run_analysis.R)
*) The CodeBook describing the various data items and their transformations from the orignal data (CodeBook.md)
*) This README.md describing the repos contents (README.md)
